        This collection represents more than just words—it's a window into the mind of someone who
        fundamentally changed how we interact with technology and think about innovation. These speeches,
        interviews, and conversations span decades of Steve's life, from his early days building Apple
        in a garage to his triumphant return and the creation of products that redefined entire industries.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-700 font-serif">
        Each piece in this compilation was carefully selected to showcase not just Steve's vision for
        technology, but his philosophy on life, creativity, and the pursuit of excellence. Whether he's
        discussing the intersection of technology and liberal arts, the importance of saying no to good
        ideas to focus on great ones, or his belief that small teams of A+ players can change the world,
        these words continue to inspire entrepreneurs, designers, and dreamers worldwide.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-700 font-serif">
        From his famous Stanford commencement speech to intimate interviews about his creative process,
        from product launches that changed industries to personal reflections on mortality and meaning,
        this collection offers insights into both the public figure and the private individual who
        believed that the intersection of technology and humanities could create something magical.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-700 font-serif">
        This is more than a historical record—it's a guide for anyone who believes that with enough
        passion, dedication, and attention to detail, they too can make something wonderful and put it
        out there for the world to experience. These words remind us that innovation isn't just about
        technology; it's about understanding human needs and creating solutions that feel almost magical
        in their simplicity and power.
