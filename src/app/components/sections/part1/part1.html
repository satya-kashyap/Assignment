      The years after Steve left Apple were among the toughest of his career—and the most formative. Determined to build
      a new great computer company, he started NeXT with several members of the Macintosh team. “We’ll make a whole
      bunch of mistakes, but at least they’ll be new and creative ones,” he predicted.

      Around the same time, Steve invested $10 million in a small company called Pixar. It was a tiny computer-graphics
      operation, newly spun off from filmmaker George Lucas’s empire. Both NeXT and Pixar quickly ran into trouble. The
      NeXT computer system, which debuted in 1988, was powerful and packed with the humanistic touches Steve loved. It
      was visually striking and intuitive to use, with high-quality audio and the complete works of Shakespeare built
      in. But it was also late to market and expensive—and it sold poorly.

      Within six years of NeXT’s launch, the entire founding team, other than Steve, had resigned. Pixar, meanwhile, was
      eking out an existence selling computers and software and, later, animating commercials. The company was also
      making award-winning short films that charmed Steve. This use of technology in service of brilliant storytelling
      embodied one of his favorite things: work at the intersection of technology and the liberal arts.

      After nearly a decade of difficulty, the streamlined NeXT and Pixar both transformed into unlikely success
      stories. At the end of 1995, Pixar premiered <em>Toy Story</em> in the same month it held its initial public
      offering. A year later, Apple, in need of operating-system software, bought NeXT for $427 million. “If you really
      look closely,” Steve liked to say, “most overnight successes took a long time.”
