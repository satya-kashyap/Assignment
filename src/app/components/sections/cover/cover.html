    "There's lots of ways to be, as a person. And some people express their deep appreciation in different ways.
    But one of the ways that I believe people express their appreciation to the rest of humanity is to make
    something wonderful and put it out there.<br /><br />

    And you never meet the people. You never shake their hands. You never hear their story or tell yours.
    But somehow, in the act of making something with a great deal of care and love, something's transmitted there.
    And it's a way of expressing to the rest of our species our deep appreciation. So we need to be true to who we are
    and remember what's really important to us.<br /><br />

    â€” Steve, 2007
